# 🎵 SoundwaveOverlay

*A minimalist media overlay app built with Rust; customizable, snappy, and entirely yours ;)*   (slogan still being worked on)

## Overview

**SoundwaveOverlay** (~ working title ~) is a lightweight desktop overlay that displays media information (like the current song, artist, and album art) using system-level integrations — no logins, no trackers, no nonsense. 

It's being built in **Rust** with a frontend powered by **Tauri**, making it ultra-performant and cross-platform.

> ⚠️ This project is a **WIP** and serves as a learning playground for me to deepen my understanding of Rust and system-level programming. Working on it in my free time, progress might be slow.

## Why I'm Building This

- To explore **Rust**: its ownership model, performance, safety, and tooling.
- To build a real-world project with clean architecture and customizable UI.
- To learn how to interact with OS-level media APIs (SMTC, MPRIS, etc.).

## Features (Planned)

- 🖥️ Transparent, click-through UI overlay
- ⚙️ Fully customizable settings with live previews
- 🎨 Template-based theming (dark/light/custom CSS)
- 🔄 Real-time system media info (Spotify, VLC, browsers, etc.)
- 🌍 Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Contributing / Feedback

I’d love to hear your thoughts!

- Suggestions?
- Criticism?
- Code pointers?
- Just wanna say hi?

Open an issue or start a discussion! This is a *passion project* , and all input is welcome as I learn and grow with Rust.
